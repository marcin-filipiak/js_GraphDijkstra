This project is a **Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualizer**, designed to illustrate the shortest path calculation in a weighted graph.  

### Features:
- **Graph Input via JSON**: Users can define nodes and edges, including weights, start, and end points.  
- **Interactive Visualization**: The graph is drawn dynamically on a canvas, with edges labeled by their weights.  
- **Color-coded Nodes**: The start node is **green**, the end node is **red**, and other nodes are **blue**.  
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Implements **Dijkstra’s algorithm** to find and display the optimal route between nodes.  

This tool is useful for students and enthusiasts learning graph algorithms in an interactive way.
